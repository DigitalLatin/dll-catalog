description: 'Nodes in this content type represent the concept of a text, not a manifestation of it. For example, unless one specifies a specific edition, translation, or other version of the text, "<em>Aeneid</em>" is a concept that people use to refer to an epic poem written by Vergil. A specific edition of the <em>Aeneid</em> should be catalogued in the Item Record content type. The DLL Work record is used for organizational purposes and to identify a work unambiguously.'
